# monolog
A standalone companion app for transcribing audio messages and extracting key information.

To download the desktop app, you just have to follow this link https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ssbQ5pIFGhJ4L8kSPc3h984KEb06VuRQ?usp=sharing and download the .zip file.
No need for additional installation of dependencies etc., just click on the executable in the unzipped folder and start using the app!

OpenAI's Whisper is being used to achieve great transcription quality, as well as NLTK and the Scikit-Learn library to extract key information. 

monoLog is a quality-of-life app designed to aid in responding to lengthy audio messages. While I still highly encourage the users to listen to messages for the nuances of emotion and simply out of respect, monoLog allows users to load the audio file, highlighting key phrases and keywords for better retention. With monoLog, responding to extended messages becomes effortless, eliminating the need for manual note-taking.


This project has been developed by me, Gergő Szabó, on behalf of a university project at the Julius-Maximilans-Universität Würzburg, on the subject of Digital Humanities. 
Showing my capability to use NLP and Machine Learning algorithms in a practical approach, by developing a (quality of life) application.
